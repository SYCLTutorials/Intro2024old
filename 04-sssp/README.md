# SSSP

 ### Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
 *  Calculate the shortest path distance from a single vertex in the graph to all other vertices.

   The goal is to study the performance of algorithms for **SSSP** using parallel computation in c++ using SYCL. 
   The first attempt will be to translate the Delta stepping algorithm found in [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_single-source_shortest_path_algorithm)

# handleWF

The `handleWF` project is designed to manipulate the wave function of an electronic structure calculation, specifically focusing on the WFX format. One of the primary applications of this code is the computation and analysis of electron density, which is a fundamental quantity in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Electron density provides insights into the distribution of electrons within a molecule or material, influencing chemical reactivity, bonding properties, and other physical characteristics. By efficiently processing wave function data, this project allows researchers to extract electron density information with high precision, leveraging modern parallel computing techniques to handle large datasets and complex calculations.

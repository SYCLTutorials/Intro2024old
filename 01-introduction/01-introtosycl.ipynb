    "One of the primary advantages of SYCL is its ability to integrate\n",
    "seamlessly with C++17 and upcoming versions, enabling features like\n",
    "lambda functions, auto-typing, and templating. This integration not only\n",
    "improves the programmability and readability of the code but also\n",
    "leverages the type safety and performance optimizations provided by\n",
    "modern C++. Here are a few key benefits: - \n",
    "* **Single-Source Development**: Unlike traditional approaches that might require\n",
    "maintaining separate code bases for different architectures, SYCL\n",
    "unifies the code into a single source. This simplifies development and\n",
    "reduces maintenance burdens.\n",
    "* **Cross-Platform Portability**: SYCL code\n",
    "can be executed on any device that has a compatible SYCL runtime,\n",
    "providing true cross-platform capabilities.\n",
    "* **Performance**: With\n",
    "SYCL, developers do not have to sacrifice performance for portability.\n",
    "It allows fine control over parallel execution and memory management,\n",
    "which are critical for achieving optimal performance on GPUs.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Lambda functions \n",
    "\n",
    "In SYCL, lambdas play a crucial role similar to their use in general programming, but they are specifically tailored for defining operations on data that will be executed on parallel devices like GPUs and CPUs. Like in other programming contexts, lambdas in SYCL allow for writing concise, anonymous functions. This capability is especially valuable in SYCL due to the nature of parallel computing, where operations often need to be defined locally and executed across a range of data elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambdas in SYCL are structured similarly to standard C++ lambdas, but are specifically utilized within the SYCL framework to define the functionality of kernels that execute on parallel compute devices. The basic syntax of a lambda in SYCL can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "[capture_clause](input_signature) -> return_specification {\n",
    "    // execution_block\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of SYCL you typically encounter the following types of captures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[]` : Captures nothing from the enclosing scope. This is used when the lambda does not need to access any external variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[&]` : Captures all accessible variables from the surrounding scope by reference. Useful when you need to modify the external variables or when copying them is expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[=]` : Captures all accessible variables from the surrounding scope by value. This is safe when the lambda is executed asynchronously or on a separate device, ensuring that it works with a consistent copy of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when defining a SYCL kernel, a developer might use a lambda to specify the computation that each thread should perform on the elements of a buffer. This lambda can capture necessary variables from its surrounding scope to use within the kernel execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "buffer<float, 1> buf(data, range<1>(data_size));\n",
    "queue.submit([&](handler& cgh) {\n",
